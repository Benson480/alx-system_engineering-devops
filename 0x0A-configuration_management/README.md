#Configuration Management
#Configuration management is the process of maintaining software and computer systems (for example servers, storage, networks) in a known, desired and consistent state.
#It also allows access to an accurate historical record of system state for project management and audit purposes.

#System Administrators mostly perform repetitive tasks like installing servers, configuring those servers, etc. These professionals can automate this task, by writing scripts.

#However, it is a difficult job when they are working on a massive infrastructure. The Configuration Management tool like a Puppet was introduced to resolve such issues.
